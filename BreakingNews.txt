Time change
it dont matter if u change time or no the game will change time. anything with a timer, raids cresting any march doves and ap but6 to fix would say
stop all raids and remover them, make sure ap is done don't count on doves ascend now !!!! have it ready to ascend again when time changes if needed. it is better safe than sorry later.

after time change try 1 raid or march if time is me4ssed up don't send any more wait clean history wait a couple hrs try again or u can stop raids and try 1 after 30 minutes after 
time change and refresh 1 is messed up don't start any more u can go into your rally point and edit each raid click save and march again try 1 if that's good send more but will have to edit them 1 at a time 
for me I just remove them
pop reach has its own time change which can affect you between the hrs of 2 am eastern time and 4:55 am eastern time and now u see the issue
